THIS SMASHING SYSTEM is ment to bring Vegas to ther knees!!!!

Eventually the predition_generator will be used to make predictions.

The user will Select from a dropdown list the leauge, season and week then when 
the submission occurs. A "log report will display in a pie chart formatt the 
past or future results and pending options"

Where we are at 

We have the ability to return a list of home teams on a targeted season and week.
To use that list we need to fix the problem of setting the end date. I feel
at if there are home teams on that list that need to filter out so my 
first attempt to fix this problem will be to try to add a filter to only get 
the home teams that played on that end date
